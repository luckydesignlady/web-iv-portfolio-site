    <h2>Designer Rebrands Local Fundraiser</h2>
<p>Hawgs for Dogs is an annual Poker Run that benefits Guide Dogs of America. While the event has grown in popularity every year, organizers wanted to provide a cohesive brand identity for riders. A number of materials have been created for Hawgs for Dogs, from a logo, to promotional posters for the ride, to T-shirts, to business cards.</p>

<p>The target audience for this design is middle-age bikers, both men and women, many of whom spend a great deal of time and money giving back to the community. The design needed to be  unique to Hawgs for Dogs, yet consistent with Guide Dogs of Americaâ€™s brand as well.</p>
