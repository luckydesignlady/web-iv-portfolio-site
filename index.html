    <h1>Graphic Design in Lincoln, Nebraska</h1>
<h2>A passion for design with a special love for print</h2>


<p>means that I take a special interest in each and every project that I take on. I am choosing to fill my portfolio with my favorite projects. These are the designs that I have revisited and ‘loved’ a million times over. I hope that you love them as much as I do!</p>


<h2>About</h2>
<p>I am a graphic designer who recently graduated from SCC’s Graphic Design/ Media Arts program. It took me longer than some to figure out what I wanted to ‘do with my life’, but after designing gig posters for a DJ friend of mine, I learned that I am in love with design, and take special pride in my work, if you can even call it that. I love every aspect, from typography, to layout, to color, to photography, and take pride in my attention to detail.</p>

<p>My favorite projects are those that I feel passionate about, or have a personal connection to. In fact, some of my best work was for ‘pro bono’ clients, such as Hawgs for Dogs. I’ve always been the type of person to get behind causes that I feel strongly about, and being able to design for these organizations, such as Hawgs for Dogs, is a dream come true for me!</p>
